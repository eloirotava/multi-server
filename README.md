# multi-server

`multi-server` maps HTTP host names to directories and uses a `site.json` manifest to decide how each site is served. Static sites consume no per-site processes; HTTP applications start on their first request and stop after an idle timeout.

## Run

```sh
cargo run -- --root ./sites --listen 127.0.0.1:8080
```

Create `sites/eloi.rotava.com/site.json`:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "serve": {
    "mode": "http",
    "command": ["python3", "app.py"],
    "port_environment": "PORT"
  },
  "lifecycle": {
    "idle_timeout_seconds": 60
  }
}
```

The application must listen on `127.0.0.1:$PORT`. Then request it through the router:

```sh
curl -H 'Host: eloi.rotava.com' http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

Static sites use a smaller manifest:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "serve": {
    "mode": "static",
    "root": "public",
    "index": ["index.html"]
  }
}
```

Exact domain directories take precedence. If no exact directory exists, parent-domain manifests with `"domains": { "subdomains": true }` may handle the request.

## Current scope

This first version supports static files and HTTP applications with dynamically assigned ports. Network namespaces for applications with hard-coded fixed ports, stdio/CGI processes, HLS-specific activity leases, TLS, and file watching are planned follow-up capabilities.
